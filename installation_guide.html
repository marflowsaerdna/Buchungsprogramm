<a name="1"></a><h4>1. Installation of Updates</h4>
<p>To upgrade to a new version of the LuxCal Event Calendar follow the 
instructions in the file &quot;<kbd>release_notes_luxcal_xxx.html</kbd>&quot; 
(where xxx indicates the release).</p>

<a name="2"></a><h4>2. New Installation</h4>

<a name="2a"></a><h5>Requirements</h5>
<p>For the installation of the LuxCal Event Calendar on the server of your hosting provider, you will need:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A web accessible directory on a web server to install the LuxCal files.</p></li>
<li><p>The web server should be able to run php-scripts (PHP 5.1 or higher).</p></li>
<li><p>A MySQL database on the web server to store the LuxCal Event Calendar data.</p></li>
</ul>

<a name="2b"></a><h5>Installation Steps</h5>
<p>To install the LuxCal Event Calendar on the server of your hosting provider, follow the next steps:</p> 
<ul>
<li><p>Create a MySQL database on the server to store the LuxCal calendar data. Ask your hosting provider 
		if they provide a tool for you to do this.</p>
		<p>For later use, remember the name of the database server (host name), the database name and the 
		username and password to access the database.</p></li>
<li><p>Uncompress the downloaded LuxCal zip-file in a temporary location and upload all files and 
		directories to a Web accessible directory on the server where you wish to install LuxCal.</p></li>
<li><p>Point your Web browser to the directory of the LuxCal installation; it should redirect you to the
		&quot;install.php&quot; script and show the Installation page.</p></li>
<li><p>On the Installation page enter the database details and the administrator name, e-mail address 
		and password and click &quot;Install.&quot;  The script will generate the necessary tables in the 
		database and display the content for your configuration file. Using a <strong>plain</strong> text 
		editor, cut and paste this content into a new file and save it as &quot;config.php&quot;. Note: 
		do not use Word or Wordpad, but use for instance Notepad or Notepad++.</p></li>
<li><p>Upload the file <kbd>config.php</kbd>; to the root directory of your LuxCal installation.</p></li>
<li><p>Launch the calendar by browsing to the calendar's URL to ensure the calendar displays properly.</p></li>
<li><p>After successful installation, delete the file <kbd>install.php</kbd> from the server.</p></li>
<li><p>Point your Web browser to the directory of the LuxCal installation to start the LuxCal calendar.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep a backup copy of the <kbd>config.php</kbd> file. It contains the parameters for the MySQL 
		database, the administrator credentials and the calendar configuration settings.</p></li>
</ul>

<a name="3"></a><h4>3. Calendar Configuration</h4>

<a name="3a"></a><h5>Configuration Variables</h5>
<p>The calendar configuration variables which are automatically generated during the installation process 
are stored in the configuration file <kbd>config.php</kbd>. Most settings can be changed at a later stage 
by the calendar administrator via the Settings page in the drop down menu on the navigation bar at the 
top right corner of the screen.</p>
<p>For those interested in technical details: The following are explanations of the PHP variables stored in 
the configuration file <kbd>config.php</kbd>:</p> 
<ul>
<li><p><kbd>$hn</kbd>, <kbd>$db</kbd>, <kbd>$un</kbd> and <kbd>$pw</kbd> correspond to the host name 
		(e.g. localhost), database name, user name and password of the MySQL database used by LuxCal.</p></li>
<li><p><kbd>$dbPrefix</kbd> if not blank, this variable is used as a prefix for the database names. 
		This may be useful if you are short of databases and want to share the database with other 
		applications, or if you want to use several separate LuxCal calendars. The prefix could for 
		instance be <kbd>lc1_</kbd> or <kbd>db1_</kbd>, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><kbd>$calendarTitle</kbd> is the title of the LuxCal calendar that is displayed in the header

		if disabled: clicking an event will always first open the Event Details window where the Edit 
		button has to be selected to open the Edit Event window.</p></li>
<li><p><kbd>$userMenu</kbd> specifies whether the user filter is displayed in the  
		calendar's options panel. Possible values: 0 = don't display the user filter menu, 1 = display the

</ul>

<a name="3b"></a><h5>3.1 Installing Automatic Periodical Functions</h5>
<p>The following automatic periodical functions are available:</p>
<ul>
<li>Email notification messages for event due dates</li>
<li>Daily email messages with calendar changes</li>
<li>Automatic deletion of unused user accounts</li>
</ul>
<p>To make the automatic periodical functions work, a cron job needs to be created on the server (or 
on an external server), which executes the file <kbd>lcalcron.php</kbd>, in the root directory of the 
calendar, daily at approx. 2:00am. For cron job details see the header of the <kbd>lcalcron.php</kbd> 
file.</p>
<p>If you are not familiar with cron jobs, ask your hosting provider for help.</p>

<h6>- The Email Notification Feature</h6>
<p>For events entered in the calendar the user can choose to receive an email reminder (notification) 
one or several days before the event is due. When chosen, for recurring events (e.g. birthdays) an email 
notification will be sent to the user the selected number of days before each occurrence of the event. 
Imagine: never forget to buy flowers for your (girl)friend's birthday anymore!</p>
<h6>- Receiving Calendar Changes by Email</h6>
<p>In a multi-user environment it could be useful to be aware of changes being applied to the calendar 
content, i.e. a list with events added, edited and deleted. Such a list can be called up via the options panel. It is however also possible to have a list with changes 
automatically sent daily to one or more email addresses.</p>
<p>Via the Settings page the administrator can specify the number of days to look back for changes and 
a list with email addresses. If the number of days to look back for changes is set to 0 (zero), no 
emails with changes will be sent.<p>
<h6>- Automatic Deletion of Unused User Accounts</h6>
<p>The account of users who have not logged in during a certain number of days can be automatically 
deleted. Via the Settings page the administrator can specify the number of 'no login' days after which 
the user account will be deleted. If the number of 'no login' days is set to 0 (zero), no user accounts 
will be deleted.</p>
<p>This function can be particularly useful when users are allowed to self-register (this feature can 
be switched on/off on the admin's Settings page).</p>

<a name="3c"></a><h5>3.2 Installing a New Language</h5>
<p>= Note: in the following text the part {language} (including the braces) of the file names represents 
		the name of the relevant language. =</p>
<p>A new language for the user interface of the LuxCal calendar can be installed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download and unzip the desired language pack from the LuxSoft site.</li>
<p>If your language pack is not available:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>translate the files <kbd>lang/ai-english.php</kbd> and <kbd>lang/ui-english.php</kbd> (translate 
		the texts to the right of the => signs) and save the files with the names <kbd>ai-{newlang}.php</kbd> 
		and <kbd>ui-{newlang}.php</kbd> respectively.<br />
		Use character encoding <strong>utf-8 without BOM</strong> (see note below).</p></li>
<li><p>translate the file <kbd>lang/ug-english.php</kbd> (leave the html tags unchanged) and save it with 
		the name <kbd>ug-{newlang}.php</kbd>.<br />
		Use character encoding <strong>utf-8 without BOM</strong> (see note below).</p></li>
</ul>
<li><p>upload the files <kbd>ai-{newlang}.php</kbd>, <kbd>ui-{newlang}.php</kbd> and 
		<kbd>ug-{newlang}.php</kbd> to the <kbd>lang/</kbd> directory on the server.</p></li>
<li><p>on the Settings page (see Calendar Configuration Settings in Section 4 below), change the user  
		interface language in the Calendar Settings to the new language.</p></li>
<li><p>if the user interface language menu is displayed in the calendar's options panel, the new installed
		language will automatically be added to the menu.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b> When using special characters (e.g. accents) in the language files, the ui and 
		ug files must be saved with character encoding: <kbd>utf-8 without BOM</kbd> (Byte Order Mark). If 
		your text editor does not support <kbd>utf-8 without BOM</kbd>, you can download and use Notepad++ 
		(<a href="http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/uk/site.htm">Notepad++ on Sourceforge</a>).</p>

<a name="4"></a><h4>4. Managing the Calendar</h4>
<p>Managing the LuxCal calendar is the responsibility of the calendar administrator, who has all calendar 
		access rights.</p>
<p>In order to define users, to set up categories for the calendar, to change configuration settings and 
		to add events, you must select Log In in the navigation bar at the top right corner of the screen. 
		Enter the administrator name or email address and password you specified during the installation, 
		and log in. On the right side of the navigation bar the administrator drop down menu will be 
		displayed.</p>

<a name="4a"></a><h5>Event Categories</h5>
<p>A good place to start in managing your calendar is to create a number of categories for your events, each 
		with its own color. Adding categories with different colors - though not required - will greatly enhance 
		the views of the calendar. Categories can be for example: meeting, important, holiday, birthday, etc.</p>
<p>The initial installation has only one resource which is named "no cat". To manage categories, select 
		Categories in the administrator drop down menu. This takes you to a page with a list of all categories 
		where you can add new categories and edit or delete current categories.</p>
<p>When adding / editing events the defined categories can be selected from a pull down list. The order in 
		which categories are displayed in the pull down list is determined by the Sequence field on the 
		Categories page.</p>
<p>The field Repeat can be used to pre-define recurring events. A resource "birthday" or "anniversary" can 
		be set to repeat every year. If a repeat value is specified, all events defined in this resource will 
		repeat as specified. The repeat value specified here will overrule possible user 'repeat' settings.</p>
<p>The checkbox "Public" can be unchecked to exclude certain event categories from being viewed by the 
		"Public User" and from the RSS feeds.</p>
<p>The fields Text Color and Background define the colors used to display events in the calendar belonging 
		to this resource.</p>

<a name="4b"></a><h5>Calendar Users</h5>
<p>The Users menu in the navigation bar allows the calendar administrator to add and edit users, their 
		rights for using LuxCal and their user interface language. There are two main areas that can be edited, 
		i.e. the name / e-mail address / password area and the access rights area. Possible access rights are: 
		&quot;View&quot;, &quot;Post Own&quot;, &quot;Post All&quot; and &quot;Admin&quot;. It is important to 
		use a valid email address for each user to be able to receive email notifications of due dates of 
		events. For each user the default user-interface language can be specified. Whenever a user logs 
		in, the user-interface language will be set to this language.</p>
<p>The initial installation has two users defined. One is the Public Access user, who initially has "view" access
		and the other is the calendar administrator, with the administrator name, email address and password 
		specified during the installation. The administrator has all access rights.</p>
<p>Unless the calendar administrator has given &quot;View&quot; access to Public Access users, users must log 
		in to use the calendar using their name or email address and password. Depending on the type of user, 
		a user can have different access rights which can be set by the calendar administrator.</p>
		<p>If the administrator has enabled, on the Settings page, user self-registration, users can register 
		themselves via the Login page. Self-registered users have the access rights specified by the administrator 
		on the Settings page.</p>

<a name="4c"></a><h5>Calendar Database</h5>
<p>The Database menu in the navigation bar allows the calendar administrator to start the following functions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>check and repair the database.</p></li>
This function checks the 'event' table and the 'dates' table of the database on inconsistencies and, when 
found, repairs the inconsistencies. The number of inconsistencies found is indicated for each table.
<li><p>compact database</p></li>
During normal use of the calendar, when deleting events, the event records are not physically deleted from 
the database, but are marked as 'deleted'. They can still be used in views and reports; for example in the 
Changes view. 
The compact database function permanently removes events from the database which have been marked as 
'deleted' longer 30 days ago. Thereafter all tables are compressed to free unused space and to reduce 
database overhead.
<li><p>backup database</p></li>
This function creates a backup of the structure and contents of all database tables in the <kbd>files/</kbd> 
directory. The file name is <kbd>cal-backup-yyyymmdd-hhmmss.sql</kbd> (where 'yyyymmdd' = year, month, and 
day, and hhmmss = hour, minutes and seconds). The file type is <kbd>.sql</kbd> and the created file can 
directly be used to re-create the database tables structure and contents, for instance by importing the 
file in the phpMyAdmin tool which is available on the server of most web hosts.
</ul>

<a name="4d"></a><h5>CSV File Import</h5>
<p>CSV (Comma Separated Values) text files with event data can be imported into the LuxCal calendar. This 
		function can for instance be used to import a CSV file with event data exported by MS Outlook. The dialogue 
		to import CSV files is opened by selecting CSV Import from the admin drop-down menu in the navigation bar.</p>
<p>The CSV file contains one line per event and each line contains a number of fields each separated by a comma 
		(or any other unique character). The order of the fields in each line of the CSV file is: title, venue, 
		resource id, date, end date, start time, end time and description. The first line of the CSV file is ignored 
		by the import function and can be used for column descriptions (default in MS Outlook exports).</p>
<p>Sample CSV files - with different date/time formats - can be found in the <kbd>files/</kbd> directory of the 
		LuxCal Calendar installation and have the file extension ".csv".</p>

<a name="4e"></a><h5>iCal File Import/Export</h5>
<p>Events from iCalendar files can be imported into the LuxCal calendar. The content of the iCal file to be 
		imported must meet the [<u><a href='http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545' target='_blank'>RFC5545 
		standard</a></u>] of the Internet Engineering Task Force. The LuxCal calendar can also export events 
		into an iCal file which can be downloaded by the calendar administrator. The dialogue to import/export 
		iCal files is opened by selecting iCal Import / iCal export from the admin drop-down menu in the 
		navigation bar.</p> 
		<p>This function can for instance be used to back up the events of your LuxCal calendar, or to exchange 
		events with other calendars, e.g. to import public holidays available in iCal format on the internet. 
		Please note that some LuxCal event fields are not supported in the iCal format (e.g. private event, notify, 
		email addresses) and consequently are not copied to the iCal file. Some iCal event repetition rules are not 
		supported by the LuxCal calendar; these events will be displayed and earmarked as such, but will not be 
		added to the calendar.</p>
	<p>Various sample iCal files can be found in the <kbd>files/</kbd> directory of the LuxCal Calendar 
		installation and have the file extension ".ics".</p>

<a name="4f"></a><h5>Calendar Configuration Settings</h5>
<p>The Settings page in the administrator's menu on the navigation bar can be used to easily change the 
		calendar's configuration variables which are stored in the <kbd>config.php</kbd> file (see section 3 above). 
		These variables, for instance, define the calendar title, the time zone, the language file to be used for 
		the user interface, the default initial view when the calendar is started, the number of weeks/months 
		displayed in the various views, the date and time format, etc.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: Currently the TimeZone is set to &quot;Europe/Amsterdam&quot;. If you are in a different time 
		zone, change the TimeZone to your local time zone. See the 
		<a href="http://us3.php.net/manual/en/timezones.php">PHP Supported Timezones</a> for possible  values.</p>

<a name="5"></a><h4>5. Embedding the Calendar in an Existing Web Page</h4>
<p>To use the calendar on an other web site, the following possibilities are available:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>link to the calendar's URL, which will open the calendar in a new page.</p></li>
<li><p>embed a mini calendar, which can be used to view events and - if enabled by the admin - add, edit and delete events.</p></li>
<li><p>embed the full calendar with navigation bar, which the visitor can use to change the options the calendar.</p></li>
<li><p>embed one specific calendar view without navigation bar. The visitor cannot change the options of the calendar</p></li>
</ul>
<a name="5a"></a><h5>Link to the Calendar</h5>
<p>To link to the LuxCal calendar in an existing web page and open it in a new window, the following HTML 
code can be used:

<a name="5b"></a><h5>Embed a Mini Calendar</h5>
<p>A mini calendar with a (minimum) width of 160px can be embedded in your web site. An example is shown on 
the LuxCal Demo page of the LuxSoft web site. The mini calendar can be displayed in an inline frame (iframe) 
using the following HTML code: 
</p>
<br />
<code>
&lt;iframe class="lcmini" id="lcmini" src="http://www.mysite.xx/luxcal/lcmini.php" width="210px" height="233" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
</code>
<br /><br />
<p>Via the CSS styles, the class <code>lcmini</code> can be used to position and define the style of the 
iframe containing the mini calendar.</p>
<p>The height of the mini calendar varies depending on the month to display (4, 5 or 6 weeks) and therefore 
the following JavaScript code, which dynamically adjusts the height of the iframe, must be added to the  
<code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of the parent web page:</p>
<br />
<code>
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
<br />
function setHeight(newHeight){var plus=(document.all)?8:0; document.getElementById('lcmini').style.height=newHeight+plus+'px';}
<br />
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>
<br /><br />
<b>Please note</b>: Automatic adjusting of the iframe height only works if the calendar is located in the 
same domain as the parent page. If not, the iframe height is set to cope with displaying 6 weeks.
<br />
<a name="5c"></a><h5>Embed the Full Calendar</h5>
<p>To embed the full LuxCal calendar in an existing web page, an inline frame (iframe) can be used. This can  
for example be done with the following HTML code:
<br /><br />
<code>&lt;iframe class="luxCal" src="http://www.mysite.xx/luxcal/?cP=2" width="80%" height="800px"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</code>.
<br /><br />
With parameter <kbd>cP</kbd> the default view can be set (e.g. year: <kbd>cP=1</kbd>, month: <kbd>cP=2</kbd>, . . . ,upcoming: 
<kbd>cP=5</kbd>)<br />
Via the CSS styles, the class <code>luxCal</code> can be used to position the iframe at the desired location 
and to set the width and height to fit your needs.</p>
<a name="5d"></a><h5>Embed One Specific Calendar View without Navigation Bar</h5>
<p>To embed the LuxCal calendar without navigation bar, the parameter <kbd>hdr=0</kbd> should be added to the 
URL as follows:
<br /><br />
<code>&lt;iframe src="http://www.mysite.xx/luxcal/?hdr=0&cP=2" width="80%" height="800px"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</code>.
<br /><br />
</p>
<p>The visitor will not be able to navigate the calendar and select other views. The following parameters 
can be added to select the view to display and the user-interface language:</p>
<ul>
<li><kbd>cP</kbd> to set the view (e.g. year: <kbd>cP=1</kbd>, month: <kbd>cP=2</kbd>, . . . ,upcoming: 
<kbd>cP=5</kbd>)</li>
<li><kbd>cL</kbd> to set the user-interface language (e.g. French: <kbd>cL=Francais</kbd>). The specified 
language must be present in the <kbd>lang/</kbd> directory)</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>For example the HTML code to show the Upcoming Events page without navigation bar, in the French language  
looks as follows:
<br /><br />
<code>&lt;iframe src="http://www.mysite.xx/luxcal/?hdr=0&cP=5&cL=Francais" width="80%" height="800px"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</code>.
</p>
<br />
<p>Via the CSS styles the iframe can be positioned at the desired location and the width and height can be 
set to fit your needs.</p>
<br />
<p><b>Important:</b>
<br />
The parameter <kbd>hdr=0</kbd> is remembered via the PHP session mechanism; this means that if you access 
the embedded calendar without navigation bar, then thereafter, when accessing your normal (not-embedded) calendar when your session is still active (max. one hour)
you will also see no navigation bar. This can be solved by adding the parameter <kbd>hdr=1</kbd> to the URL of 
your normal calendar.</p>
