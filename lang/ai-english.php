<p>On this page the following functions can be selected:</p>
<h5>Check and repair database</h5>
<p>This function will scan the calendar tables and check for errors. If an error
is found, the error will be repaired, if possible.</p>
<p>If the calendar views don't show any problems, running this function once a 
year should be sufficient.</p>
<h5>Compact database</h5>
<p>When a user deletes an event, the event will be marked as 'deleted', but will 
not be removed from the database. The Compact Database function will permanently 
remove events deleted more than 30 days ago from the database and free the space 
occupied by these events.</p>
<h5>Backup database</h5>
<p>This function will create a backup of the full calendar database (tables 
structure and contents) in .sql format. The backup will be saved in the 
<strong>files/</strong> directory with file name: 
<kbd>cal-backup-yyyymmdd-hhmmss.sql</kbd> (where 'yyyymmdd' = year, month, and 
day, and hhmmss = hour, minutes and seconds.</p>

CSV file, used for column headers, is ignored.</p>
<h5>Sample CSV files</h5>
<p>Sample CSV files (file extension .cvs) can be found in the 'files/' directory 
of your LuxCal download.</p>
<h5>Date and time format</h5>
<p>The selected event date format and event time format on the left must match the 
format of the dates and times in the uploaded CSV file.</p>
<h5>Table of Categories</h5>
<p>The calendar uses ID numbers to specify categories. The resource IDs in the CSV 
file should correspond to the categories used in your calendar or be blank.</p>
