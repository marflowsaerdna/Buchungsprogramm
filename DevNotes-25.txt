= LuxCal Development Notes =
============================

To do for this version:
======================
None.

To do for next versions:
=======================
1. Store calendar settings in the database and scramble the database credentials
2. Make a printer friendly print button in Month view.
3. Separate styles sheet for mini-calendar.
4. Add admin setting to enable/disable "authentication required" for posting via 
   mini-calendar.


Done for version 2.5.0:
======================
1.  event.php, eventForm0.php, eventForm1.php, eventForm2.php: Edit the series 
    or one specific occurrence of a repeating or multi-day event. If just the 
    occurrence is edited, the original occurrence of the repeating, or multi-day 
    event is deleted and replaced by the new (edited) event. If just the 
    occurrence is deleted, the single occurrence will be deleted, whilst the 
    other occurrences of the repeating or multi-day event stay in place.
2.  event.php, eventForm1.php, eventForm2.php, ui-{lang}.php: An admin function 
    has been added: when a user with admin rights creates/edits an event, at the 
    end of the Add/Edit Event window a drop-down list with registered users is 
    displayed. From this list the admin can select a user who will become the 
    owner of the event. And, if Show Owner is enabled, the owner of the event 
    will be displayed in the Event Details window.
3.  $exportICS.php, retrieve.php, ai-{lang}.php: On the iCal File Export page it 
    is now possible to specify the name of the exported file; the file will be 
    stored in the "files/" directory and can be downloaded into apps on mobile 
    devices (e.g. a smart phone). Furthermore the event owner has been added to 
    the export filter, which makes it possible to export event of an individual 
    owner. The date range selection (events occurring between two dates) has 
    been improved to cope with repeating and multi-day events (based on the 
    common/retrieve.php script).
4.  header.php, footer.php, upcoming.php, changes.php, general.js: Print button 
    mechanism changed so that class="noprint" is used rather than name="noprint" 
    Name attribute is not valid for <div>'s, and doesn't work in IE. To save 
    ink/toner, when printing the background color of the page(s) to print is now 
    set to 'white', with the exception of the event titles.
5.  retrieve.php, event.php, year.php, month.php, dw_functions.php, ui-{lang}:
    When Show Owner is enabled by the admin, the onmouseover popup will show 
    the owner and the last "editor" (last edited by).
6.  upgrade250.php, install.php, retrieve.php, event.php, changes.php, notify.
    php, importCSV.php, importICS.php, exportICS.php, database.php, sendchg.php: 
    MySQL 'dates' table dropped and fields moved to the 'events' table. Now that 
    the editing of single occurrences of repeating and multi-day events has been 
    implemented in an efficient and elegant way (no explosion of repeating and 
    multi-day events into individual events), there is no need any more to have 
    separate 'events' and 'dates' tables.
7.  index.php: code to emulate register_globals OFF added. Security issue.
8.  header.php: In side bar ";" added to &nbsp without ";" and <input> tag [+] 
    properly closed with " />".
9.  dw_functions.php: getElementsByName replaced by getElementsByTagName. Name 
    is a proprietary element not supported by IE - wtf!. Tagname <span> replaced 
    by <var> (<var> is unique in LuxCal).
10. year.php, month.php: <colgroup> replaced by <col> (xhtml validator didn't 
    like <colgroup>.
11. css.php: The style for class topText was accidentally removed. Used for the 
    title in the event window and the help window.
12. notify.php: between header line and notifications blank line removed. After 
    notifications blank line added.
13. retrieve.php, year.php, month.php, upcoming.php, changes.php, header.php, 
    rssfeed.php, lcmini.php: evtList sorting centralized in retrieve.php script.
14. css.php: Header problems. "margin:auto" dropped in class floatC to satisfy 
    IE7!
15. year.php, css.php: Some unnecessary (double defined) classes removed. Class 
    textS removed from style sheet.
16. dw_functions.php, header.php, setting.php, ai-{lang}.php: the admin can now 
    set the time slot size in day/week view to 10, 15, 20, 30 or 60 minutes and 
    the time slot display height from 10 - 60 pixels.
17. event.php: if no space between the URL and the link name, the link name was 
    not recognized. URL regex changed so that the space is now optional.
18. year.php, month.php, dw_functions.php, lcmini.php, css.php: different styles 
    for private events and repeating/multi-day events in onmouseover popup box 
    moved to the styles sheet.
19. eventform2: removed private event checkbox in the Edit Event window for  
    public access users.
20. eventform2, ui-{lang}.php: in the Edit Event window, every "5th" and "6th" 
    day/week/month/year added to the repeat function.

As of version 2.5.1:
====================
21. settings.php: Hover popup transparent. In popon call class not properly set.
22. eventform2.php: "\n" displayed at the top of the window.
23. css.php: When private + repeating, the onmouseover popup didn't show private
24. event.php: when an edited repeating event doesn't validate, the choice "edit 
    series or occurrence" is displayed. When selecting "occurrence", the changes 
    are lost.
25. lcmini.php: onmouseover popups for repeating events were transparent. Class 
    "normal" added to repeat events.
26. month.php, css.php: in month view give month text a background color to make 
    a new month stand out.
27. changes.php, sendchg.php: error in "Changed on" date if m_date not present 
    in db table events.
28. retrieve.php, sendchg.php: "call-time pass-by-reference" is deprecated and 
    as of version 5.3.0 PHP generates a warning. Pass-by-reference removed.
29. lcmini.php: when calling up the full month the current date ("cD") argument 
    was wrong and caused a problem when displaying exactly one month in Month 
    view.
30. lcalcron.php, notify.php, sendchg.php, userchk.php, ai-{lang}.php: Cron job 
    admin summary - sent when executing lcalcron.php - improved. All user 
    interface texts moved to the ai-{lang}.php files. Cron job explanation in 
    lcalcron header improved.
31. lcalcron.php, settings.php, ai-{lang}.php: Setting added to admin's settings 
    page to enable/disable the emailing of the admin cron job summary.
32. event.php, notify.php: Sender / owner removed from email reminder (was not 
    very useful).
33. cpicker.js: Added 29 more colors to the color picker used to select text and 
    background colors for event resources.
34. event.php, css.php: Added a class for warning messages (in addition to error
    and confirmation messages) and changed the blocking error "notification date 
    in past" into a non-blocking warning.
35. css.php, lctheme.php: the calendar's user-interface color definitions have 
    been moved from the styles sheet to a new separate file, called lctheme.php. 
    This makes it easier for users to create their own theme with tailored 
    colors.
36. event.php, eventForm0.php, eventForm1.php, eventForm2.php: when the admin 
    creates an event for someone else or changes the owner of an event, the 
    reminder email address should be set to the email address of the new owner.
37. exportICS.php: if on the iCal export page no "occurring between" dates are 
    specified by the user, the start and end date will be set to -1 year and +1 
    year respectively. This is to avoid overflow in case of repeating events 
    without "until" date.
38. rssfeed.php: time format display error solved and session parameters used by
    the retrieve function initialized.
39. {all files}.php: attribute checking and other measures added to solve the 
    SQL injection vulnerability of the calendar and to avoid malicious use and 
		unauthorized access to the MySQL database. The text LuxCal followed by the 
    version number removed from the endbar.
40. retrieve.php: slashes (introduced by "magic_quotes_gpc") are now stripped 
    from all text fields at the source. Scripts using $evtList don't need to 
    strip slashes again.
41. users.php: the admin rights of the calendar administrator cannot be removed 
    anymore, neither can users with admin rights remove their own admin rights.
42. retrieve.php, categories.php, ai-{lang}.php, install.php, upgrade251.php: on 
    the admin's Categories page for each event resource public view can be 
    enabled/disabled.
43. header.php, lcmini.php: to avoid duplicate content for search engines, a 
    canonical link tag has been added to the html header.
44. event.php: on the edit event page, the admin's list to set/change the event 
    owner, also showed deleted users. Fixed.
		
As of version 2.5.2:
====================
45. event.php: in sanity check "isset" replaced by "!empty" .evDate could be set 
    but empty, which gave problems when adding an event via the "+".
46. sendchg.php: the counting of the number of changes for the admin's cron job 
    report was incorrect.
47. retrieve.php, changes.php, sendchg.php: column indexes replaced by aliases. 
    Good programming practice; no change for the user.
48. index.php, categories.php, users.php, dloader.php: sanity test too strict 
    for languages with special characters (e.g. accents)
49. events.php, header.php: for the public user, in the cat menu in the header 
    and Edit Event window, only show the categories which have been checked as 
		'public' on the admin's categories page.
50. sendchg.php: events in change list sorted per change date in the same way as 
    events are in the calendar views.
51. install.php: in categories table resource name length changed from 20 chars 
    (utf-8: 10 chars) to 40 chars (utf-8 20 chars).
52. exportICS.php: added a test to check if the writing of the export file to 
    disk was successful. If not successful, an appropriate error message will be 
    displayed.
53. database.php: added a test to check if the writing of the backup file to 
    disk was successful. If not successful, an appropriate error message will be 
    displayed.

As of version 2.5.3:
====================
54. event.php, settings.php: 1-click, or 2-click event editing has become an 
    admin Setting in the General settings.
55. dw_functions.php, css.php: simplified the html code for display of the event 
    title in the event box. One <div>-level and class 'inner' redundant.
56. css.php, lctheme.php: styles scrutinized, font sizes reviewed and converted 
    from 'px' to 'em' and the size of certain fonts moved to lctheme.php to make 
    it easier for the users to change font sizes.
57. retrieve.php, header.php, sendchg.php, changes.php, month.php, upcoming.php: 
    if for an event resource no background color has been specified, the back- 
    ground of events in that resource will be transparent and take the color of 
    the underlying calendar (rather than the color white).
58. dtpicker.php, header.php, header_s.php, eventform2.php, changes.php, 
    importICS.php, exportICS.php: On the date picker the close button has been 
    replaced by a clear button for those date fields which may be blank. The 
    close button is not needed because the date picker closes automatically or 
    can be closed by re-selecting the button that opened it.
59. header.php, changes.php, upcoming.php, sendchg.php, rssfeed.php: "while ... 
    each" replaced by "foreach". More transparent, no copy of event data and to 
    resolve the $evtList reset problem (bug in Upcoming view and side bar).
60. header.php, upcoming.php, ui-{lang}.php: Display "None." when list is empty.
61. changes.php: in the Changes view the resource filter and categories.public 
    filter didn't work. Error in database query solved.
62. categories.php, users.php, database.php, settings.php, exportICS.php, 
    importICS.php, importCSV.php: "you are not authorised.." message scrutinised 
    and moved to ai-{lang} files.
63. retrieve.php: event list sorted on dates to get the upcoming events in the 
    side bar in the correct order.
64. categories.php, users.php, importCSV.php, importICS.php: activation of 
    various buttons changed from JavaScript (onclick) to more robust html (<a>) 
    code.
65. importICS.php, css.php: bug in processing event date/time fields solved and 
    problem with half-size erroneous fields solved (error class).
66. header.php, eventform1.php, eventform2.php: input tag with 'type="button"' 
    replaced by button. No functional changes, but logical and shorter.
67. event.php: when adding or editing events, html tags are stripped from the 
    title, venue and description. Html tags could mess up the calendar display.
68. dloader.php: setting default time zone added to avoid PHP warning messages 
    which are sent before the headers and interfere with the download.
69. toolbox.php: allow for event dates in the previous century (e.g. birthdays)
70. header.php, general.js, css.php and several other php files: individual drop 
    down menus in the navigation bar replaced by an Options-panel.
71. index.php, login.php: 'Remember me' checkbox added to log in page. Cookies 
    combined with sessions to avoid logging in every time.
72. categories.php, header.php, event.php, exportICS.php, import ICS.php, 
    importCSV.php: when deleting a resource, it is not physically removed from 
    the database, but its status is set to 0 (like it's done for users and for 
    events.
73. rssfeed.php: problem solved with the missing definition of default time zone 
    and the resulting PHP 5.3 warning messages.
74. header.php, css.php: aligning of text in top bar simplified and less prone 
    to problems in the different browsers.
75. footer.php: RSS feed link added to the footer bar.
76. header.php, ui-{lang}.php: An entry "Back to calendar" added at the end of 
    the admin's drop-down menu.
77. database.php: If during the calendar installation a prefix was specified for 
    the database tables the admin's database functions operated on all tables in 
    the database. This has been fixed so that only tables starting with the 
    prefix are affected.
78. settings.php, ai-{lang}.php, install.php, upgradexxx.php: new admin setting 
    which defines the start month (1 - 12) in year view. The value 0 has a 
    special meaning: the start month is based on the current date and will fall 
    in the first row of months.
79. dtpicker.js: width of time-picker window increased to ensure the four time 
    columns fit in all browsers.
79. upgrade.php: test on successful writing of config.php file added.
80. login.php: on the login screen, the change my data screen and the register 
    screen measures have been taken to select the right submit button when the 
    user hits the Enter key.
81. notify.php: no email reminder should be sent for a repeating or multi-day 
    event on the day of a changed occurrence. The changed occurrence determines 
    if a reminder should be sent.
82. events.php: when an event is edited by an other user (with "post all" 
    rights), the event owner should remain unchanged, unless the owner is 
    explicitly changed by the admin.
